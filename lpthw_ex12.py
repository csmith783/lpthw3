# Prompting People

# This is how you prompt for input from the user. 
age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")

# use of f-strings to insert variables directly into a string 
print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
